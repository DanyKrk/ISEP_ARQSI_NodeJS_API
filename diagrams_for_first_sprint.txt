Typically, the types of diagrams used in ARQSI to architecturally
represent the software according to the 4+1 model:
* Logical view: component diagram, and class diagrams are also used to
represent the domain (domain model).
* Process/behavior view: sequence diagrams. In other cases, they can be
used for activity, status, ...
* Implementation view: package diagrams. In other cases component
diagrams can also be used.
* Physical view: node diagram.
* Scenario view: Use case diagram, but system sequence diagrams may be
applicable (these are also level 1 process view diagrams).
